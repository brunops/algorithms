# Algorithms
This repo intend to be a place to centralize implementations of different algorithms studied online, from sources like:

## Online courses
* [Introduction to Algorithms 6.006](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011)
* [Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503) 6.046J](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005)
* [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 ](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004)

## Programming sites
* [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com/tc)

## and anywhere really..
By the way, no unique language is being used to solve the problems, just what I feel like at the time..
